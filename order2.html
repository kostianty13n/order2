<h1>  Time In A Bottle </h1>
<h2>Jim Croce<h2>
 <h3> <p>If I could save time in a bottle </p>
<p>The first thing that I'd like to do </p>
<p>Is to save every day 'til eternity passes away </p>
<p>Just to spend them with you </p> <h3>
<h4><p>If I could make days last forever </p>
<p>If words could make wishes come true </p>
<p>I'd save every day like a treasure, and then </p>
<p>Again, I would spend them with you </p> <h4>
<h5><p>But there never seems to be enough time </p>
<p>To do the things you want to do once you find them </p>
<p>I've looked around enough to know </p>
<p>That you're the one I want to go through time with </p>
<p>If I had a box just for wishes </p>
<p>And dreams that had never come true </p> <h5>
<h6><p>The box would be empty </p>
<p>Except for the memory of how they were answered by you </p>
<p>But there never seems to be enough time </p>
<p>To do the things you want to do once you find them </p>
<p>I've looked around enough to know </p>
<p>That you're the one I want to go through time with </p> <h6>

  <p title="never give up "> Franklin's father really wanted to give his son an education,
   but his funds were only enough to pay for two years of schooling.
   However, this did not prevent Franklin from being a passionate lover of books,
   inventing a lightning rod and bifocal glasses and
   becoming one of the founding fathers of America.  </p>
